**`AI Highlight Clip` is a free, open-source desktop application that automatically discovers and clips multiple short videos with viral potential—the "highlight moments"—from long-form content like interviews, courses, and livestreams.**

Have you ever faced hours of video footage, endlessly scrubbing the timeline just to find a few exciting clips? This project is designed to solve this exact pain point, aiming to free knowledge-based and interview-style content creators from tedious editing work and exponentially boost their productivity.

## ✨ Core Features

This isn't just a clipping tool; it's a complete AI content re-creation pipeline:

-   **🤖 AI-Powered Core Engine**:
    -   **Automatic Speech Recognition**: Integrates the powerful `OpenAI-Whisper` model to accurately transcribe dialogue in multiple languages into timestamped subtitle files.
    -   **AI Intelligent Analysis & Scoring**: Leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to deeply understand the transcribed text, assigning a "Highlight Score" to each potential video clip to automatically discover the most valuable and shareable content.
    -   **AI Viral Title Generation**: Simulates a top-tier content marketing expert to automatically generate catchy, platform-friendly short video titles for each selected highlight.

-   **🎬 Fully Automated Clipping Workflow**:
    -   **Long-Form to Short-Form Video Matrix**: Supports processing single video files or entire directories (like a TV series or a course set), converting long content into a matrix of dozens of ready-to-publish short videos with a single click.
    -   **Intelligent Sliding-Window Slicing**: Uses an efficient sliding-window algorithm to scan the entire content without missing any potential highlight moments.
    -   **Intelligent Highlight Filtering**: Automatically filters the top N best clips based on AI scores, keyword density, and content overlap to avoid repetition.

-   **🎨 Highly Customizable Output**:
    -   **Dynamic Subtitle Embedding**: Optionally burns subtitles directly into the video, with support for custom fonts. An advanced built-in algorithm optimizes line breaks and layout for a better viewing experience.
    -   **Freely Configurable Parameters**: Users can freely set the desired number of clips, target duration, highlight keywords, and more, offering flexible control over the final output.
    -   **Cross-Platform GUI**: Built with PyQt5, providing a consistent, clean, and intuitive user experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### System Requirements

1.  **Python**: 3.8 or higher.
2.  **FFmpeg**: **Must** be installed and added to the system's PATH environment variable.
    -   Windows Users: `ffmpeg.exe` is included in the project, so no extra installation is usually needed.
    -   macOS/Linux Users: Please visit the [FFmpeg official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for installation instructions.
    -   To check if it's installed correctly, open a terminal or command prompt and type `ffmpeg -version`. You should see version information.
3.  **API Key**: A DashScope (Qwen, from Alibaba Cloud) API Key is required.

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/toki-plus/ai-highlight-clip.git
    cd ai-highlight-clip
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Installing `openai-whisper` may require a `rust` build environment. If you encounter issues, please refer to its official documentation.*

4.  **Configure API Key:**
    -   Before the first run, open the `config.ini` file.
    -   Fill in your DashScope API Key in the `api_key` field.

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python ai_highlight_clip.py
    ```

## 📖 Usage Guide

1.  **Step 1: Configuration**
    -   Paste your key into the "Qwen (DashScope) API Key" input field in the software interface.
    -   Select the "Speech Recognition Language" and "Speech Recognition Model" as needed (more accurate models are slower and require better hardware).

2.  **Step 2: Select Input**
    -   Click the "Browse..." button to select a single video file or a folder containing multiple videos.

3.  **Step 3: Set Clipping Parameters**
    -   **Number of clips to generate**: How many short videos you want in the end.
    -   **Target clip duration**: The approximate length of each short video in seconds.
    -   **Highlight keywords**: Enter important keywords (separated by commas or spaces). The AI will prioritize clips containing these words.
    -   **Add Subtitles**: Check this box to automatically burn subtitles into the final videos.

4.  **Step 4: Start Generating**
    -   Click the "🚀 Start Generating" button.
    -   The program will begin tasks like speech recognition, AI analysis, and clipping. You can monitor the real-time progress in the log window.
    -   Processing time depends on the video length and your computer's performance, so please be patient.

5.  **Step 5: Get Your Clips**
    -   A notification will pop up when the task is complete.
    -   Click the "📂 Open Clips Directory" button to find all the generated short videos in the `output_clips` folder.
